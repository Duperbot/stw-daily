# Fortnite: Save the World Daily Rewards Discord

This is a discord bot that will collect your daily reward by using API requests. It is an adaptation of [this repository](https://github.com/Londiuh/fstwrc)

## Requirements and dependencies
* Python (Tested with 3.8.5)
* Discord.py
* Requests
* psutil (only used for some statistics. It is not essential to the functionality of the bot and can/should be removed)
* An account with campaign access (Save the world)

## How to start the bot
Edit the token with your bots token (located on the last line), then run the python file.

Alternatively, you can [Use my publicly one hosted on heroku here.](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=757776996418715651&permissions=313344&scope=bot)

You can also join my server if you would prefer to use the bot that way.

## How to use the bot
The bot's default prefix is ``stw``. You can change it manually at the top of the file.

The built in help commands are: ``stw help`` and ``stw instruction``; the latter of which will provide more detailed instructions.

First, [visit this website](https://www.epicgames.com/id/logout?redirectUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.epicgames.com%2Fid%2Flogin%3FredirectUrl%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.epicgames.com%252Fid%252Fapi%252Fredirect%253FclientId%253Dec684b8c687f479fadea3cb2ad83f5c6%2526responseType%253Dcode) and sign in with your **Epic Games** account.

You will then be redirected to a website that will look something like this:

```js
{"redirectUrl":"https://accounts.epicgames.com/fnauth?code=a51c1f4d35b1457c8e34a1f6026faa35","sid":null}
```

Copy the code (you can double click it in most browsers), and then append that to your command.

For example:

``stw daily a51c1f4d35b1457c8e34a1f6026faa35``
This code will expire shortly after it is issued. If you require a new code, you can simply refresh the page and it should generate a new one.

## Support
If you require assistance, just want to chat, or would prefer to use the bot in a different server to your own, you can [join the STW Daily discord](https://discord.gg/Mt7SgUu)
